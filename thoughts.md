Being prepared: Making a calendar that has a detailed layout of class times, tasks to be completed, and deadlines for those tasks.
Attention to detail: Making sure you're writing the proper syntax, and also relaying clear and concise direction/information to your teammates, like in the Driver/Navigator scenarios.

Additional strategies:
Reviewing notes directly after the session to gain more comfortability with what we have learned.
Doing pre-work: Reading over the next session, and also taking notes on that session before the next meeting in order to better focus and not feel so overwhelmed.
